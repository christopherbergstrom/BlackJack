How to use: First, enter how much money you brought, then enter how much of that you would like to bet. You are then shown
your cards and one of the dealer’s cards and given the option to hit, stand, or double depending on the amount of your bet
and the amount of money you have left. If you win, you are given the option to play another game or cash out. If you lose and
have money left you can choose to play again or cash out. However if you don’t have any money left you can choose to leave or
look in your car for some more money or sell your watch to the dealer.<br>
